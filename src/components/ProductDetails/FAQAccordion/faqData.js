    answer: ` We have plans to create courses on many topics including
        IELTS, Xero & Quickbooks, Freelancing Marketplace
        Overview. Once these courses are created, they will be

    question: "Will I join this academy today and become rich from tomorrow? ",
    answer: `The answer is no. Thousands of people have succeeded in learning what I teach, but many have not been able to do anything again. If you think that buying a course will make you a big rich person - then you are wrong. Many other courses can make such promises - I do not make such promises. There are people who have sold my website for over à¦¹à¦¾à¦œà¦¾à¦° 50,000 or more through my courses, there are people who are earning à¦¹à¦¾à¦œà¦¾à¦° 5,000 per month as SEO experts, and there are people who can't do anything.
